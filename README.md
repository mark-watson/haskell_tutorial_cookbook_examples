# Examples for "Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook" by Mark Watson

![Haskell Logo](haskell.svg)

This repo contains the examples for my Haskell book that I try to update with new material about once a year:

[Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/haskell-cookbook)

## I am starting to use this repo for all personal Haskell projects.

In the future, if you see a file named **NOT_YET_IN_BOOK.md** in any subdirectory, then please don't expect (yet) that this example is in the book. Currently everything in this repo is in the second edition of my book.

## Updates

Updated 3/5/2022 for stack resolver: lts-lts-18.27

## Tool Installation

See Appendix A in my book, or simply install **stack** and **hlint**.

Note: 6/18/2020: install directions in Appendix A to optionally install **cabal-install** (with latest GHC 8.8.3) produces an error running:

        stack install cabal-install

Installing **cabal-install** is optional. Installing **stack** using the directions in Appendix A which refers you to th official documentation at [http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html is sufficient for running the exampes in my book.
